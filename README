Install openldap, postfix and dovecot packages.
You can run install.sh for quick install or 
 *.fix scripts to configure individual servers.
 
 All config files are copied from /etc/machiNET/<servername> to destination.
 You can customize them before.

You can customize passwords for openldap ( in slapd.conf ) and roundcube's mysql database
(in kolab-x.x.sql) before ran the script.


 
 The install.script will configure your server as authoritative for domain machinet.ro 
 There are also few places in roundcube you must change the domain name, and, obviously, in Apache.
 
run ./enable-kolab to enable kolab services
 
 You can change, modify or comment this script as you wish.
 Also, you can contribute by sending me a mail at mihai at badici dot ro
