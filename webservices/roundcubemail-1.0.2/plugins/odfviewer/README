Roundcube Open Documents Viewer
-------------------------------
The rendering of open documents is based on the WebODF library written
by Tobias Hintze. See http://webodf.org for more information.


INSTALLATION
------------
Make the the folder 'files' in this directory writeable for the webserver.
It is used to temporarily store attachment files. Also make sure in the
webserver configuraton that this directory is not browsable. For Apache
webservers the included .htaccess file should already do the job.

Add 'odfviewer' to the list of plugins in the config/main.inc.php file
of your Roundcube installation.
