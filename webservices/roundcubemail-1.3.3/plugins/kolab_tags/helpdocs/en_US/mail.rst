Like folders, tags is a way to separate and organize Emails. Tags are showing up as a colored reference in the subject line of the referenced Emails.

Tags can be reused across the Kolab components - Email, Calendar, Notes, Files and Tasks.

When a tag is associated with a number of Emails, these Emails can be listed by clicking the tag in the tag-cloud.
It is possible to select more than one tag using CTRL key. This way one can display messages associated with all selected tags.

The tag-cloud can be found under the :ref:`folder list <mail-folders>` in the Email view. It is showing all available tags.

Managing tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tags can be managed through the menu in the tag-cloud. The menu is opened by clicking the wheel in the buttom of the tag-cloud.
Here you can add/remove tags or modify their name and color.

Tags are associated to Email messages via the drop-down menu in the Email list.


Deleting tags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A tag which is no longer needed can be removed via the tag-cloud menu. This will remove the tag from the cloud and the references to the associated Emails. The Emails will however remain.
