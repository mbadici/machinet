Library providing common functions for calendar-based plugins
-------------------------------------------------------------

Provides utility functions for calendar-related modules such as

* alarms display and dismissal
* attachment handling
* iCal parsing and exporting
* iTip invitations handling

iCal parsing and exporting is done with the help of the Sabre VObject
