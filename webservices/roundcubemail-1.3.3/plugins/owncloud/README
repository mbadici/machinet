Connecting Roundcube with ownCloud
==================================

ATTENTION: this is just a proof-of-concept and should be be considered for
production use.

This plugin integrates ownCloud into the Roundcube web UI using iframes.
Beside giving the user one single location to log-in and get access to all
his/her data, the integration should also allow one to pick files from
ownCloud when sending email messages and to store email attachments directly
to the cloud.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

The plugin embeds the web UI for ownCloud though an iframe into the Roundcube
user interface. When accessing ownCloud though Roundcube, the user's login
credentials (username + password) will be handed over to ownCloud in order to
automatically authenticate the current Roundcube user to ownCloud. This
exchange happens with HTTP requests directley between the ownCloud server and
the Roundcube server using signed URLs to prevent from interception.

IMPRTANT: The automatic user authentication only works if both apps use the
same authentication backend. In the Kolab realm this is LDAP. You therefore
need to configure the LDAP user authentication backend in ownCloud.

Once authenticated, the user sees the ownCloud file manager within Roundcube
and can do whether he/she is authorized to do. When composing a new email
message in Roundcube, an addition button appear to select files from the
ownCloud storage. (this feaure is not yet fully implemented).

When terminating the session in Roundcube by pressing the Logout button, an
according message is sent to ownCloud to termiate the user's session there, too.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

* Roundcube version 0.9-beta or higher
* ownCloud version 4.5 or higher
* both apps running on the same host (due to browser's XSS protection)
* both IMAP and ownCloud authenticate users on the same backend


INSTALLATION
------------

Install this plugin in Roundcube and enable it.

Rsync the contents of the copy_to_owncloud folder to the ownCloud installation.
This will add a new app named "kolab_auth" and a theme "kolab" to ownCloud.


Roundcube CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

Copy the config.inc.php.dist file to config.inc.php in Roundcube's owncloud
plugin directory. Then edit the file and set the absolute URL where ownCloud
is accessible and define a secret string for the authentication credential
exchange between the swo systems.


onwCloud CONFIGURATION
----------------------

Add the following lines to the ownCloud config array:

  'theme' => 'kolab',
  'kolaburl' => '<url-to-roundcube>',
  'kolabsecret' => '<shared-secret-string>',

The value for 'kolabsecret' has to match the 'owncloud_secret' string in
the Roundcube owncloud plugin configuration.

Log-in to ownCloud as an administrator and enable the kolab_auth app.
