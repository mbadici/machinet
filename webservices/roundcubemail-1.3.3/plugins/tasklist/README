A task management module for Roundcube
--------------------------------------

This plugin currently supports a local database as well as a Kolab groupware
server as backends for tasklists and todo items storage.

INSTALLATION
------------

When usigng the database driver, some initialization of the local database is
necessary. To do so, execute the SQL commands in
drivers/database/SQL/<yourdatabase>.initial.sql

For some general calendar-based operations such as alarms handling, this
plugin requires the `libcalendaring` plugin which is also part of the
Kolab Roundcube Plugins repository. Make sure that plugin is installed
and configured correctly.

IMPORTANT
---------

This plugin doesn't work with the classic skin of Roundcube because no
templates are available for that skin.
