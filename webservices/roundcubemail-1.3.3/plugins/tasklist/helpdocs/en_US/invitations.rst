Handle Task Assignments
=======================

You can assign other people to a task. This will send out invitation emails to all
assignees with the task data attached. That allows one to directly accept
or decline the invitation.

Chapter :ref:`calendar-invitations` describes how email invitations work
for event participants. The same applies for task assignees.
