Overview
*************

The content area of the tasks screen is divided into three areas: the :ref:`Tasks <tasklist-tasks>`
itself, the :ref:`Tags <taskslist-tags>` and the :ref:`Tasklist Selector <tasklist-lists>`.


.. index:: Tasks
.. _tasklist-tasks:

The Tasks List
==============

The main content are lists the task items that match the current selection of active lists,
filters and tags. The listed tasks are sorted by due date (ascending) and completed ones move to the bottom.

    Tasks can be organized hierarchically and the list appears like a tree structure.
    A small arrow icon on the left side of a task bar indicates subordinated tasks and expands or collapses
    the tree upon click.

    Some basic editing like flagging, assigning a due date as well as completing tasks can directly be done in the list
    by clicking the checkbox, the flag icon or the date selector.

A single click anywhere else on a task bar displays all details in a dialog box. Hit <Esc> on the keyboard
or click the close icon to hide it again.

Double-clicks open the clicked task item for full detail editing.


Control the List
----------------

Quick Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The selection your tasks displayed on the screen can be refined in various ways. Use the quick filters
above the list to reduce the listed tasks according to their status or due date.

.. _taskslist-tags:

Tags
^^^^

The tags list on the left is another way to display a selection of tasks. Click a tag to only display tasks
with this tag assigned. Click it again to show all. Hold down the <Shift> key on the the keyboard to select
mutliple tags and further reduce the selection.

Task Lists
^^^^^^^^^^

The checkboxes in the :ref:`tasklist-lists` box control whether tasks from the according list are 
currently displayed. Use the *Quick View* icon |quickview| in the list to quickly reduce the view to tasks from a single
list. This can also be used when the according list isn't activated. Click it again to turn off quick view mode and
return to regular display of active lists.

After searching, you can still use the filters and tags as explained above to hide some results.
